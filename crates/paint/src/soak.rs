//! Soak-stain: thinned paint poured onto raw, unprimed canvas soaks into the
//! cloth instead of lying on it as a film (Frankenthaler's stains from 1952,
//! Morris Louis's veils). The physics and its sources are in
//! notes/research/soak_stain.md; numbers marked "estimate" there are
//! estimates here too.
//!
//! **The cloth** holds liquid in its pores (`Fabric::cap_um`, µm of liquid
//! per area when saturated). Its threads are capillaries: liquid wicks
//! faster along the warp than across it, and faster along some threads than
//! others, so a stain is a little elongated along the warp and its edge
//! feathers along the threads.
//!
//! **A pour** (`Canvas::pour`) lands where its mask says and wicks outward.
//! The liquid reaches the cloth in order of capillary travel (a
//! shortest-path front over the cloth's permeability, Washburn's law giving
//! the times) and fills each pore volume it reaches until the poured volume
//! is used up; where more was poured, it pushes further. Cloth that is still
//! wet lets new liquid through easily (it mixes and runs on); cloth that
//! holds oil takes little and slows it.
//!
//! **Pigment** rides in the liquid and the fibres filter it as it passes
//! (deep-bed filtration: the denser near the pour, the paler far from it;
//! fine pigments travel further than coarse ones). What is still suspended
//! when the turpentine evaporates is drawn toward the drying edge and left
//! there (a ring: the more turpentine, the stronger). The pour lays the ring
//! at once, not as the stain dries; the cloth keeps no separate account of
//! loose and settled pigment (`blot` lifts a share of all of it).
//!
//! **Turpentine** darkens the cloth while it is there (liquid in the air
//! gaps between the fibres: "darker when wet") and evaporates over the next
//! hour, the edges first. **Oil** beyond what the fibres and the pigment
//! hold creeps on past the colour for a day or two until it gels, leaving a
//! darker, yellowing halo; paint thinned so far that too little oil is left
//! to wet the pigment dries lean, pale and matte.
//!
//! **Brushed paint** on bare cloth (`Canvas::sink`, as it bakes): the cloth
//! takes its oil, so it sets sooner (`RAW_SET`) and dries lean, matte and
//! paler; oil the fibres under it can't keep creeps on past the stroke as a
//! halo (`Canvas::sink_halo`). Its film seals the cloth against pours.
//!
//! **Appearance**: the cloth is one Kubelka–Munk layer over a backing. Its
//! scattering is lowered where liquid fills the pores, and the deposited
//! pigments' absorption and scattering are added to it, so a stain is
//! colour *in* the cloth: the weave shows through it.
//!
//! **Limits.** A raw canvas is painted whole, never as a crop render. A
//! pixel keeps one arrival of creeping oil, so where halos overlap their oil
//! arrives together, at the mean of its times by volume (the cloth is right
//! once all of it has arrived). Recolouring the cloth (oil arriving, oil
//! yellowing) replaces those pixels' colour: lighting `relief` added there is
//! lost, and a film thinner than 0.001 coats counts as bare cloth.
