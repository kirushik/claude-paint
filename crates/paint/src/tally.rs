//! The hand's ledger: what the brushes did, and an estimate of the hand
//! time it takes.
//!
//! Every mark the canvas makes is counted here as it is planned (strokes,
//! their path length, stipple touches, trips to the palette to reload or mix
//! a new pile, wipes on the rag), and each is priced in seconds of hand time
//! (`pace`). Painting nothing here: the ledger only counts. What a caller
//! does with the time is up to it.
//!
//! Counting happens where the engine plans marks, on the whole canvas and in
//! a fixed order, before the tiles are split among threads or a crop drops
//! the ones off its window: the ledger is the same at any thread count. In
//! a crop it is the same but for what looks at the pixels the crop holds:
//! the look-and-fill dabs (which gaps it sees), and for aimed marks
//! (`color_over`, a stipple's look under a dip) the color a dip asks for,
//! so whether it is a reload or a new pile, and with a sitting's palette
//! (`Piles`) the piles later dips find. With hand time on the ledger is the
//! clock, so a crop can age its paint by a little more or less than the
//! whole canvas does.
