//! Time and drying: the painting has a clock, and wet paint ages.
//!
//! Oil paint dries by oxidation: the oil takes up oxygen, cross-links and
//! turns from a liquid into a gel into a solid film. The film passes four
//! stages:
//!
//! - **open**: fully workable. Blends wet into wet, brushes lift and push it,
//!   it levels. It stiffens slowly as it ages.
//! - **setting**: close to the gel point. Stiff and sticky: a brush lifts
//!   little and pushes less, fresh marks no longer level.
//! - **tacky**: past the gel point the film is a sticky solid. It doesn't flow,
//!   mix or come up on the brush, but it grabs: a brush dragged over it
//!   leaves its paint quickly and in broken patches (stick and slip).
//! - **touch-dry**: a skin. New paint sits on top without mixing, as it does
//!   on dry paint. (Through-drying under the skin takes weeks to months and
//!   isn't modeled.)
//!
//! Each pixel's open film carries its own oxidation progress `cure`
//! (0 = fresh, 1 = touch-dry). Its rate follows from the paint laid there:
//! pigment (`Paint::drying`: lead white and umber are driers, bone black and
//! lakes slow), thickness (thick films dry slower) and oil content (fat,
//! medium-rich paint dries slower than lean). Fresh paint worked into an older
//! film dilutes its cure by volume as it is laid (engine 1: at the next
//! `wait`). When the film reaches the gel point it levels for as long as it
//! was fluid, then it bakes into the dry picture: from then on it is part of
//! the surface and its tack lives on in `sub` until it is touch-dry. So a pixel can hold new wet paint over a set layer.
//!
//! `Canvas::wait(minutes)` advances the clock. `Canvas::dry()` waits until all
//! paint is touch-dry. The per-pixel drying state is allocated on the first
//! `wait`; a painting that never waits doesn't allocate it.
